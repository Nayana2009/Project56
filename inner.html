     <p>I like reading books when i am free and when there is nothing else to do or when it is really boring.It is fun to read books as books feels like a joy that brings colors in your life.When i read books I feel like i am in a different world of imagination and feel like i am in the story book i am reading.I like many genre of books like fantasy,science-fiction,investigation and i love some of the books from 1800s.My favorite book is The Secret Garden it is a book of the 1900s and it is really interesting.I am also into ghost books like i have read fifteen books of goosebumps and i loved it and i have read the ghost stories of shimla and the witches by Ronald Dahl.Overall,i love to read books! </p>
